Jitendex adds a lot of information and styling to its glossaries. This addon
strips all that information, leaving only the definitions in plaintext.

## Usage

In the addon's settings, set `glossary_field` to the name of the field you want
to update. Optionally change the separator strings. If you don't want to
automatically format new cards, change `update_new` from `true` to `false`.

In the card browser, select the notes you want to update, and click "Simplify
Jitendex glossary" in the *Edit* menu.

Some words have an explanatory note, e.g. 見せ物. This will be added in
parentheses, as in the example below.
