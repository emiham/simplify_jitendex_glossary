Jitendex adds a lot of information and styling to its glossaries. This addon strips all that information, leaving only the definitions in plaintext.

## Usage

In the addon's settings, set `glossary_field` to the name of the field you want to update. Optionally change the separator strings. 

New cards will be automatically formatted when you add them. You can disable this by changing `update_new` from `true` to `false`.

In the card browser, select the notes you want to update, and click *Simplify Jitendex glossary* in the *Edit* menu.
